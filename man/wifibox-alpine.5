.Sh NAME
.Nm wifibox-alpine
.Nd wifibox based on Alpine Linux
.Sh INTRODUCTION
The implementation of the
.Xr wifibox 8
embedded wireless router is based on the use of a Linux-based guest
operating system which can communicate with the host's wireless
network card on behalf of the host.  In order to meet the requirements
of this setup, this has to be a system with a low resource footprint
and easy to manage.
.Pp
Alpine Linux is an actively maintained, security-oriented, lightweight
Linux distribution that is based on musl libc and busybox.  For more
information and introduction to the tools that are going to be used
in the sections below, please visit the following sites:

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION
By default, the guest is created with a
.Sy root
user, which is associated with a blank password.  This can only be
used to login to the guest via the
.Cm console
command of
.Xr wifibox 8 ,
no other services are configured for remote access.
.Pp
Although the
.Sy root
user possesses unlimited access to every resource inside the guest,
files cannot be changed from there.  That is because the operating
system is built in a way that it does not normally require any write
access to the contents of the root file system.  Everything that needs
to be modified during the guest's run time is stored on dedicated file
systems that are either memory-backed or shared with the host.  This
prevents the guest from damaging the system files on sudden shutdowns,
which may occur due to short and strict time limits placed on the
spin-down sequence.
.Pp
For the ease of management, the host shares configuration files with
the services that are responsible for implementing the domain logic.
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Sy wpa_supplicant
works with the
.Pa wpa_supplicant.conf
file and handles the configuration of the wireless
networks.  This is the same tool that is used in the FreeBSD base
system for the same purpose, and it is utilized here to make it
possible to reuse the configuration files of the same format.
.It
.Sy ifup
and
.Sy ifdown
work with the
.Pa interfaces.conf
file to associate the internal network interfaces with IP addresses:
.Sy wlan0
is the wireless device which is automatically configured through DHCP,
.Sy eth0
is the virtual Ethernet device which is configured according to the
contents of the configuration file.
.It
.Sy udhcpd
works with the
.Pa udhcpd.conf
file and implements a DHCP server for
.Sy eth0
so that it can hand out IP addresses in a given range for the host and
set itself the default gateway for forwarding the network traffic.  It
also manages the distribution of information about the name servers.
.El
.Pp
The configuration files are read from the
.Pa /media/etc
directory where the
.Sy config
9P (VirtFS) share is mounted in read-only mode.  From there, the files
are hooked up in the system in the following ways.
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Pa /media/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
is mapped to
.Pa /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
where
.Sy wpa_supplicant
will read its contents.
.It
.Pa /media/etc/interfaces.conf
is mapped to
.Pa /etc/network/interfaces.conf
which is included as part of
.Pa /etc/network/interfaces
when managed by
.Sy ifup
and
.Sy ifdown .
.It
.Pa /media/etc/udhcpd.conf
is mapped to
.Pa /etc/udhcpd.conf
where
.Sy udhcpd
will read its contents.
.El
.Pp
The variable data files under the guest's
.Pa /var
directory are shared with the host by mounting the
.Sy var
9P (VirtFS) share under the standard
.Pa /var
directory.  This includes streaming out all the logs under the
.Pa /var/log
directory, such as
.Pa /var/log/dmesg
or
.Pa /var/log/messages
so that the internal state of the guest can be tracked by accessing
these files on the host.
.Sh STARTING, STOPPING, AND RESTARTING SERVICES
Every service running on the guest can be managed by the
.Sy rc-service
(locate and run OpenRC service) command, which is going to be used in
this section.  The list of actively managed services can be learned as
follows.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rc-service --list
.Ed
.Pp
The status of a specific service can be queried by the
.Cm status
command.  For example, the
.Sy wpa_supplicant
tool has its own associated service and it can be checked by the following
command.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rc-service wpa_supplicant status
.Ed
.Pp
Similary to this, the
.Cm start ,
.Cm stop ,
and
.Cm restart
commands are available as well to start, stop, or restart the given
service, respectively.  In the example below, consider re-initializing
all the network interfaces by restarting the
.Sy networking
service.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rc-service networking restart
.Ed
.Pp
These commands can help with troubleshooting and restoring the
respective services in case of failures.
.Sh MANAGING THE ROOT FILE SYSTEM
When changing the contents of the guest's root file system is desired,
it may be accessed from the host directly.  It is shared via 9P
(VirtFS), which means that the files are visible and modifiable
through the host.  But because it still features Linux binaries, use
of the
.Xr chroot 8
command is recommended to launch a Linux-based shell (i.e. BusyBox)
inside the directory that holds the guest root file system on the
host.  Because some of the commands may depend on the contents of the
.Pa /var
directory, first it must be mounted from its place with the help of
.Xr mount_nullfs 8 .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mount -t nullfs /var/run/wifibox/appliance \\
  %%ROOT%%/var
# chroot %%ROOT%% /bin/ash
.Ed
.Pp
For the rest of this document, the commands are discussed in such an
environment, unless stated otherwise.
.Sh INSTALLING OR REMOVING PACKAGES
The list of installed packages can be queried by the
.Sy apk
(Alpine Package Keeper) tool.  This tool is going to be used for the
rest of the section.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# apk list --installed
.Ed
.Pp
Before installing any package, it is recommended to get the latest
version of the database.  The
.Sy apk
tool stores the list of currently used package repositories in the
.Pa /etc/apk/repositories
file.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# apk update
.Ed
.Pp
Individual packages can be then installed by the
.Cm add
command, assuming that they are available.  For example, in case of
the
.Sy wireless-tools
package, this works as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# apk add wireless-tools
.Ed
.Pp
The unneeded packages can be removed by the
.Cm del
command.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# apk del wireless-tools
.Ed
.Sh PERFORMING UPGRADES
It is possible to upgrade the operating system running on the guest to
receive fixes for the kernel, drivers, and the userland programs.  The
entire process can be managed with the help of the
.Sy apk
tool.
.Pp
First make sure that the local package database is brought in sync
with latest versions of the configured repositories.  This can be
verified by checking that the proper version numbers are used in the
.Pa /etc/apk/repositories
file.  In addition to this, before moving between major or minor
versions, e.g. from Alpine Linux 3.14 to 3.15, it is important to
ensure that the system is on the latest available version for the
current branch, and then try to pull the package index for the next
major or minor version.  That is required otherwise
.Sy apk
may report an untrusted signature due to lack of the necessary
certificates to verify the fresh ones.
.Pp
As soon as everything is properly prepared, refresh the package index.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# apk update
.Ed
.Pp
The system can be then upgraded in a single step by using the
.Cm upgrade
command.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# apk upgrade --available
.Ed
.Pp
Restart the guest for these changes to take effect by issuing the
following command on the host.  Note that one can get back to the host
system by exiting the shell, e.g. by the
.Cm exit
command.  Remember to unmount the guest's
.Pa /var
file system if it has been mounted earlier.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# exit
# umount %%ROOT%%/var
# wifibox restart guest
.Ed
.Sh CAVEATS
Custom modifications to the guest file system are not supported.  Use
the respective commands at your own risk!

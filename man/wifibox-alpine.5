.Sh NAME
.Nm wifibox-alpine
.Nd wifibox based on Alpine Linux
.Sh INTRODUCTION
The implementation of the
.Xr wifibox 8
embedded wireless router is based on the use of a Linux-based guest
operating system which can communicate with the host's wireless
network card on behalf of the host.  In order to meet the requirements
of this setup, this has to be a system with a low resource footprint
and easy to manage.
.Pp
This solution is derived from Alpine Linux, which is an actively
maintained, security-oriented, lightweight distribution, based on
.Sy musl libc
and
.Sy busybox.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION
The guest is created with a
.Sy root
user, which is associated with a blank password.  This can only be
used to login to the guest via the
.Cm console
command of
.Xr wifibox 8 ,
no other services are configured for remote access.
.Pp
Although the
.Sy root
user possesses unlimited access to every resource inside the guest,
files might not be changed in every case.  That is because the
operating system is built in a way that it does not require any write
access to the contents of the root file system.  In addition to that,
all the contents of the disk image is stored in a compressed format
via SquashFS and uncompressed to memory only on demand.  Everything
that needs to be modified during the guest's run time is stored on
dedicated file systems that are either memory-backed or shared with
the host.
.Pp
The image can host either
.Sy wpa_supplicant
for connecting to wireless networks, or
.Sy hostapd
for creating wireless access points, depending how it was built.  In
addition to that, a combination of
.Sy dhcpcd
and
.Sy radvd
could be used to support IPv6 traffic,
.Sy mDNSResponder
could be deployed to handle multicast DNS requests, and
.Sy forwarding
could be configured to pass traffic between originally isolated inner
and outer networks, such as UDP broadcasts.  For packet analysis,
.Sy tcpdump
is provided as an optional component.  Each application-specific
detail is going to be included below.
.Sh SHARED CONFIGURATION FILES
.Pp
For ease of management, the host shares configuration files with the
services that are responsible for implementing the domain logic.  On
the host, all the files are stored under
.Pa %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/wifibox
with additional subdirectories inside.
.Pp
The
.Pa appliance
subdirectory holds the generic configuration files.  On the guest,
they are visible on the
.Pa /media/etc
directory where the
.Sy config
9P (VirtFS) share is mounted in read-only mode.
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Sy forwarding
works with the
.Pa appliance/forwarding.conf
file.  It uses the syntax of the
.Sy socat
address specifications but it is limited to work with UDP and TCP
ports only.  Note that this is an optional component, and its presence
depends on the configuration of the guest image.  The respective
configuration file on the guest is
.Pa /media/etc/forwarding.conf ,
which is used directly from this location.
.It
.Sy hostname
sets the hostname on boot from the
.Pa applicance/hostname
file.  This is the name that is going to be visible for others on the
local network.  Changing the hostname requires updating this file and
restarting the guest.  The configuration file shows up on the guest as
.Pa /media/etc/hostname ,
which is mapped to
.Pa /etc/hostname ,
and used verbatim.
.It
.Sy ifup
and
.Sy ifdown
work with the
.Pa appliance/interfaces.conf
file to associate the internal network interfaces with IP addresses:
.Sy wlan0
is the wireless device and
.Sy eth0
is the virtual Ethernet device towards the host which are both
configured according to the contents of the configuration file.  On
the guest, this is
.Pa /media/etc/interfaces.conf ,
which is directly included as part of
.Pa /etc/network/interfaces .
.It
.Sy iptables
works with the
.Pa appliance/iptables
file and it is responsible for moving network packets (Network Address
Translation, NAT) between the
.Sy eth0
and
.Sy wlan0
interfaces.  The configuration file describes the flow of the network
packets through the interfaces.  Using
.Pa /media/etc/iptables
directly, it is loaded once at launching the respective service,
usually on boot, and cannot be modified from the guest.
.It
.Sy ip6tables
is the IPv6-enabled version of
.Sy iptables
which uses the
.Pa appliance/ip6tables
configuration file.  Its purpose is exactly the same as for its
sibling, it bridges the
.Sy eth0
and
.Sy wlan0
networking interfaces with the help of NAT.  On the guest,
.Pa /media/etc/ip6tables
is used directly in this case.
.It
.Sy mDNSResponder
works with the
.Pa appliance/mdnsd-services.conf
file and it can handle multicast DNS query packets on UDP port 5353.
The advertised services can be described by its configuration file so
that others on the network could see them.  Note that this is optional
component, and its presence depends on the configuration options of
the guest image.  On the guest, the
.Pa /media/etc/mdnsd-services.conf
configuration file is used directly.
.It
.Sy udhcpd
works with the
.Pa appliance/udhcpd.conf
file and it can implement a DHCP server for either
.Sy eth0
or
.Sy wlan0
so that it can hand out IP addresses in a given range for the host
.Sy ( wpa_supplicant )
or the clients on the wireless network
.Sy ( hostapd ) ,
and can set itself the default gateway for forwarding the network
traffic.  It also manages the distribution of information about the
name servers, in cooperation with
.Sy udhcpc
(DHCP client) when required. This is utilized only when dynamic IP
addresses are in use.  On the guest, the configuration file becomes
.Pa /media/etc/udhcpd.conf ,
which is used to generate
.Pa /etc/udhcpd.conf
that
.Sy udhcpd
will eventually read.
.It
.Sy dhcpcd
is an alternative to
.Sy udhcpc
and it is used only when IPv6 is optionally configured.  In that case,
it takes over the role of
.Sy udhcpc
and manages both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  It works with the
.Pa appliance/dhcpcd.conf
file which often holds only a handful of overrides for the default
options because otherwise they work well.
.Sy dhcpcd
is pre-configured to automatically keep
.Sy udhcpd
updated about name servers and it is employed only for
.Sy wpa_supplicant .
The corresponding file on the guest is
.Pa /media/etc/dhcpcd.conf ,
which is mapped to
.Pa /etc/dhcpcd.conf .
.It
.Sy radvd
works with the
.Pa appliance/radvd.conf
configuration file and this is the IPv6 Routing Advertisement Daemon
that implements the routing functionality in case IPv6 is enabled.  It
sends Router Advertisement messages, specified by RFC 2461, towards
the host
.Sy ( wpa_supplicant )
or the clients
.Sy ( hostapd ) ,
and sending a Router Solicitation message when requested.  These
messages are required for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration (SLAAC).
The corresponding configuration file on the guest is
.Pa /media/etc/radvd.conf ,
which is mapped to
.Pa /etc/radvd.conf .
.It
.Sy uds_passthru
is an optional service for managing the forwarding of control sockets
created for either
.Sy wpa_supplicant
or
.Sy hostapd .
It works with the
.Pa appliance/uds_passthru.conf
file, which is optional, and when it is present, it automatically
implies that the service is enabled.  The contents describe what
sockets should be exposed over configured TCP ports with the help of
.Sy socat ,
which a heavily stripped-down version of the original tool to minimize
the related security risks.  On the guest, the path of the
configuration file is
.Pa /media/etc/uds_passthru.conf ,
from where it is used.
.El
.Pp
Depending on the configuration, either the
.Pa wpa_supplicant
or
.Pa hostapd
subdirectory holds the configuration files that are used by either
.Sy wpa_supplicant
or
.Sy hostapd ,
respectively.  On the guest, they are published under the paths
.Pa /etc/wpa_supplicant
and
.Pa /etc/hostapd
where the
.Sy app_config
9P (VirtFS) share is mounted as read-write.  This will let
.Sy wpa_supplicant
or
.Sy hostapd
change the contents when instructed to do so from the host through the
forwarded control sockets and permitted by the configuration.
.Pp
.Sy wpa_supplicant
works with the
.Pa wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
file, while
.Sy hostapd
works with the
.Pa hostapd/hostapd.conf
file.  These are the same tools that are used in the FreeBSD base
system for the same purpose, and their Linux version is utilized here
to make it possible to reuse the configuration files of the same
format from the host.
.Pp
The variable data files under the guest's
.Pa /var
directory are shared with the host by mounting the
.Sy var
9P (VirtFS) share there.  This includes streaming out all the logs
under the
.Pa /var/log
directory, such as
.Pa /var/log/dmesg
or
.Pa /var/log/messages
so that the internal state of the guest can be tracked by accessing
these files on the host per the configuration of
.Sy wifibox .
The contents of the
.Pa /var/run
directory will not be visible on the host, as it is stored only in the
memory.
.Sh INTERNALS
.Pp
Further components of the guest that are not directly configurable or
visible to the outside:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Version 6.6 (LTS) of the Linux kernel and its wireless drivers are
used to communicate with exposed hardware.  It does not always work
with the latest ones, see the section on supported hardware for the
exact details.  Alternatively, it is possible to configure the image
to have Linux 6.8 (stable) which could be suitable for testing
experimental features and drivers.
.It
.Sy busybox
is a combination of tiny versions of the common UNIX utilities,
including the
.Sy ash
shell itself, shipped in a single small executable.  It provides the
execution environment for all the scripts and services.  All the
irrelevant modules were removed for security hardening.
.It
The base layout of the Alpine sytem is stripped down to the bare
minimum, and for example, the guest does not have the
.Sy apk
package manager installed since it would not be able to work.
Instead, the disk image itself should be constructed in a way that it
includes all the needed applications.
.El
.Sh STARTING, STOPPING, AND RESTARTING SERVICES
Every service running on the guest can be managed by the
.Sy rc-service
(locate and run OpenRC service) command, which is going to be used in
this section.  The list of actively managed services can be learned as
follows.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rc-service --list
.Ed
.Pp
The status of a specific service can be queried by the
.Cm status
command.  For example, the
.Sy wpa_supplicant
tool has its own associated service and it can be checked by the following
command.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rc-service wpa_supplicant status
.Ed
.Pp
Similarly to this, the
.Cm start ,
.Cm stop ,
and
.Cm restart
commands are available as well to start, stop, or restart the given
service, respectively.  In the example below, consider re-initializing
all the network interfaces by restarting the
.Sy networking
service.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rc-service networking restart
.Ed
.Pp
These commands can help with troubleshooting and restoring the
respective services in case of failures.
.Sh CONFIGURATION OF NETWORK PACKET FILTERING
The network packet filtering rules are managed by the
.Sy iptables
and
.Sy ip6tables
services, which need to be restarted so that the changes in either the
.Pa iptables
or the
.Pa ip6tables
file can take effect.  For example, in case of
.Sy iptables :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rc-service iptables restart
.Ed
.Pp
The active set of rules can be queried by the following command.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# iptables -L -n
.Ed
.Pp
Rules can be dynamically added, deleted, inserted, replaced, and
flushed through the corresponding commands of the
.Sy iptables
utility, see its documentation for the details.  The current state of
the configuration can be recorded by dumping it to temporary file
under a directory which is shared with the host, that is
.Pa /var/tmp
in this case.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# iptables-save > /var/tmp/iptables
.Ed
.Pp
The file exported this way could be then used as the main
configuration by moving it under the
.Pa %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/wifibox/appliance
directory on the host, as discussed above.
.Pp
The same set of commands apply for
.Sy ip6tables ,
where
.Sy iptables-save
has to be written as
.Sy ip6tables-save .
.Sh TROUBLESHOOTING NETWORK ISSUES
To verify the flow of network traffic, the
.Sy iptables
or the
.Sy ip6tables
(for IPv6) utility can be asked to list the rules in a more verbose
manner.  This will include the number of packets that matched each of
the rules, so their effect becomes observable.  For example, in case
of
.Sy iptables :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# iptables -L -nv
.Ed
.Pp
For finding the right configuration parameters for the rules of
network packet filtering, it is possible to additionally install the
.Sy tcpdump
utility.  It can be used to capture all the packets that are flowing
through all the networking interfaces and determine the proper IP
addresses and ports.  When invoked without any parameters, it will
start dumping all the traffic-related information to the standard
output.  For all the features and options, please consult the
documentation.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# tcpdump
.Ed
.Pp
Mind that this facility is not available by default, the guest image
has to be explicitly configured to include this as it is a security
risk.  For the same reason, its removal is recommended once the
analysis is concluded.
.Sh DEALING WITH UDP PACKETS
By design, UDP packets are not meant to passed between the
.Sy eth0
and
.Sy wlan0
interfaces which may cause certain applications to fail to work.  A
possible way to address this shortcoming is to deploy the proper
handlers to the user space and configure
.Sy iptables
to use them.  This can be requested by the
.Sy RETURN
target, which can be inserted in the
.Sy PREROUTING
chain for the NAT rules.  For example, in case of
.Sy mDNSResponder ,
the packet filtering rules have to explicitly be configured to pass
every UDP packet on port 5353 to the application for further
processing.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
-A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 5353 -j RETURN
.Ed
.Pp
For other similar uses, the
.Sy forwarding
service can be set up and the ports that are forwarded that way could
be linked to the network packet filtering logic in the same manner.
.Sh WIRELESS DIAGNOSTICS
Details of wireless configuration can be learned through the use of
the
.Sy iw
tool, which is suitable for showing and manipulating wireless devices
and their configuration.  For example, it can list the device
capabilities, such as band information (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), and
802.11n information.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# iw list
.Ed
.Pp
Scanning can be initiated as follows.  There,
.Sy wlan0
is the name of the wireless networking device, which can be considered
constant.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# iw dev wlan0 scan
.Ed
.Pp
Wireless events can be traced with the
.Cm event
command.  In the related example below, the
.Fl f
and
.Fl t
flags are added to show full frames for auth/assoc/deauth/disassoc as
well as the timestamps for each event.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# iw event -t -f
.Ed
.Pp
To determine if there is an active connection to an Access Point and
further related information can be displayed by the
.Cm link
command.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# iw dev wlan0 link
.Ed
.Pp
More details can be collected by the
.Cm station dump
command.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# iw dev wlan0 station dump
.Ed
.Sh BLOCKED WIRELESS DEVICES
Sometimes it happens that even if the driver has successfully detected
the wireless device, it is not yet ready to be used.  That is because
the use of the device might be blocked either by software or hardware
means, i.e. by a physical switch. The image contains the
.Sy rfkill
tool as part of BusyBox to unblock the wireless device.  Use the
.Sy list
command to see if
.Sy rfkill
is usable and list the available interfaces.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rfkill list
.Ed
.Pp
If the interface is shown to be blocked, use the
.Sy unblock
command to unblock it.  This can be done either by function or index.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rfkill unblock wlan
.Ed
.Pp
Or:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# rfkill unblock 0
.Ed
.Pp
Note that \(lqhard\(rq block status cannot be changed this way, as it
is typically performed by the hardware switch or it is implemented by
the firmware itself.  For example, the computer might be configured to
turn off the wireless device when the wired networking interface card
is active and the LAN cable is inserted.

.Sh SUPPORTED HARDWARE
There are a number of Linux drivers available as kernel modules.  Note
that not all of them could be used immediately because there might be
additional, often proprietary firmware files have to be placed under
.Pa /lib/firmware
for activation.
.Pp
A list of wireless cards supported by the drivers is as follows.  The
kernel modules that depend on specific firmware files are marked by
name at the end of each entry, otherwise they should be working.  The
availability of those auxiliary files is a function of how the
corresponding FreeBSD port is configured.  Some of them might be
included for certain package flavors only or disabled by default and
has to be explicitly configured and built by the user due to licensing
restrictions.  Note that this list might not be accurate and included
here for information only.

Certain vendors may assign different PCI IDs for their rebranded
products even if they ship exactly the same chipset.  For example, AMD
RZ608 is technically the same as MediaTek MT7921, but its PCI ID had
to be explictly added for the corresponding driver to make it work.
Similar situations may occur any time, please let us know if this
happens.

# FreeBSD Wifibox/Alpine

The purpose of this repository is to maintain all the configuration
files and scripts that are used for rolling out a [FreeBSD Wifibox]
guest based on [Alpine Linux] on top of its vanilla distribution.

## Warning

*This is a work-in-progress experimental software project without any
guarantees or warranties.  It is shared in the hope that is going to
be useful and inspiring for others.*

## Prerequisites

For building the virtual disk image,
[E2fsprogs](http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/) or the corresponding
`sysutils/e2fsprogs` FreeBSD package must be installed.  It also
requires to be run as `root` and the Linux ABI support has to be
activated.

## Installation

There is a `Makefile` present in the root of the repository that could
be used to drive the installation process.  It is mostly recommended
for development and testing.

```console
# make install \
	PREFIX=<prefix> \
	LOCALBASE=<prefix of third-party software> \
	MINIROOTFS=<Alpine minimal root file system tarball> \
	PACKAGES=<Alpine package set>
```

The `PREFIX` variable is optional, it is set to `/usr/local` by
default.  This is the prefix under which the guest's file system will
be constructed, in the `share/wifibox/guest` sub-directory.  It is
possible to set the `LOCALBASE` variable as well to tell if the prefix
under which various third-party utilities, such as `git` was installed
is different.

The `MINIROOTFS` variable should point to the Alpine minimal root file
system tarball for the `x86_64` architecture, which can be retrieved
from the Alpine Linux [web site](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/).
By default, that is set to `alpine-minirootfs.tar.gz`.

The `PACKAGES` variable should tell which Alpine Linux packages to
install for the guest.  Those are all must be local files with the
`.apk` extension.  By default, that is `*.apk`, which means that all
available packages are looked up in the current directory and utilized
during the installation process.

## Documentation

There is a manual page available that describes how the guest can be
used once installed.

```console
# man wifibox-alpine
```

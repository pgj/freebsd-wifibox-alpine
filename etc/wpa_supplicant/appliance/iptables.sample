# This file contains exported IP Tables data that can be read by the
# iptables-restore(8) utility.  It is not meant to be edited by hand
# but regenerated by the iptables-save(8) utility after the necessary
# changes were made via the respective iptables(8) commands.
#
# The IP Tables stored here implement a simplistic IP forwarding and
# NAT between the `eth0` (virtual Ethernet, facing towards the host)
# and `wlan0` (wireless networking) interfaces.

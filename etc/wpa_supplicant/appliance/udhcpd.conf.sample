# This is a configuration file for udhcpd(8) with relatively sane
# defaults.  Consult https://udhcp.busybox.net/udhcpd.conf for more.
#
# The value of `interface` should match with the one defined in the
# interfaces.conf file: `interface` should be exactly the same,
# `router` should correspond to `address` and `subnet` is the
# `netmask`.  According to these settings below, IP addresses are
# handed out for the 10.0.0.0/24 network.  Even though there is a
# single client expected, on quick restarts, the previously allocated
# address might not be released, so there should be some room left for
# such overlaps.  In the `opt dns` line, the `%%DNS%%` variable would
# be replaced with the IP addresses of the DNS servers as provided by
# the wireless network (wifibox extension).
#
# Change these only if this is not suitable.

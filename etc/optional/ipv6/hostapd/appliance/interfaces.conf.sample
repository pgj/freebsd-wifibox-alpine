# This is an iface stanza for interfaces(5) with relatively sane

#
# The `eth0` networking interface represents the virtual Ethernet card
# of the guest, which is shared with the host.  The `gateway` IP
# address should match with the address as it was configured on the
# host, and `address` is the guest's own address.  In addition to
# this, it is recommended to setup a Network Address Translation (NAT)
# on the host between `wifibox0` and the interface that faces towards
# the Internet.  This can be done with the help of pf(4) for example.
# Here is sample configuration, see pf.conf(5) for more information.
#
#     wlan_if="wifibox0"
#     lan_if="em0"
#     virt_net="10.0.0.0/24"
#
#     scrub all
#     nat on $lan_if from $virt_net to any -> $lan_if
#     pass log all
#
# Change these values as desired, they are here only for inspiration.
# Note that configuring the NAT requires the IP packet forwarding to
# be enabled as well.  This could be done for example by adding
# `gateway_enable="YES"` to rc.conf(5) along with `pf_enable="YES"`.
#
#     gateway_enable="YES"
#     pf_enable="YES"
#
# The gateway address on the host should be brought up by assigning an
# IP address for the `wifibox0` network interface.  For example,
# adding the following line to rc.conf(5) will implement this.
#
#     ifconfig_wifibox0="inet 10.0.0.1/24"
#
# The specified address could be then set for `gateway` at the
# definition of `eth0`.

iface eth0 inet static
  gateway 10.0.0.1
  address 10.0.0.2/24

# This is the static IPv6 address for `eth0`.  It is important that it
# should be on the same network as it was configured for the
# ifconfig(8) parameters of the `wifibox0` interface on the host.

iface eth0 inet6 static
  address fd00::ffff/64

# The `wlan0` networking interface is associated with the wireless
# networking card as it is exposed by the driver.  By this default
# configuration, the corresponding IP address is statically set to
# make it the gateway for the wireless network, see the contents of
# udhcpd.conf for the rest.

iface wlan0 inet static
  address 192.168.0.1/24

# This is the corresponding static IPv6 address for `wlan0`, which
# could be changed as needed.

iface wlan0 inet6 static
  address fd01::1/64
